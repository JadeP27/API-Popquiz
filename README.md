### Description

The client requested a multiple choice quiz that populates after clicking start.  Which includes a timer, score, and when a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted.  A FINISHED/TIMES UP alert displays once the quiz is complete.  The highest scores are saved along with the user's information.

## Installation

No installations are required in order to access the quiz.  

### Usage

Unfortunately the code doesn't loop through the array, there is no timer, the score doesn't accumulate or populate, and also the prompts don't appear once a question is answered.
